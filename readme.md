## Motivation
Full-time health care professionals cannot function without robust management systems for their patients. This systems
are incredibly costly and sophisticated. Doulas, by contrast, are often freelancers working 2 or more jobs. This
makes client management even more important and often puts sophisticated systems out of reach. __Doula Mynder__ seeks to
bridge this gap and offer a clear, intuitive management solution that meets the unique needs of birthwork.
